## Who am I?
I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
I am a 20 year old student from a small town in Texas. I study Computer Science at Texas A&M University where I will graduate in May 2019.

My professional interests include graph theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and distributed systems.

In my free time I love competitive programming, cooking, traveling, cycling, speaking French, video games, and drinking tea.
In the future I would love to get into long-distance backpacking and gardening.

Eventually I will finish writing Cadmus, the first AI for Hero Chess, a chess variant I work on with my friends.

## What do I do?
Mostly sleep. But besides that...

Starting July 2019 I will be working full time at Amazon in Seattle.

During the Summer of 2018, I worked in Seattle as an SDE Intern at Amazon FinTech developing an internal headcount tracking tool. I also explored the beautiful
nature surrounding Seattle and ate xiaolongbao as often as I could afford to.

From May to December of 2017, I worked in Bryan, TX as a part-time software engineer at Viasat developing a remote wireless configuration and deployment tool.

In the Summer of 2016, I worked as a software engineering intern at the late and great startup Epoch Labs,
helping develop a NoSQL distributed database and an automated testing infrastructure for it.
